# Your own Mondriaan
Maybe you know the paintings of the Dutch painter Piet Mondriaan. One of his famous works consists of rectangles in different colors.

In this assignment you are going to create a painting like that. You can do that by reading the CSV file and draw the rectangles as described in that file.

The CSV contains per square an X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, width, height and color. Note that you need to convert the String description of the colors to a Color object that you can use in the SaxionApp (For example ``Color.RED``)

Please note: You can use a class to store the properties of the square before you draw them.

## Example output
Your painting should look like this.
